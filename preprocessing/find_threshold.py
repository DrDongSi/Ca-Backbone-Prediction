"""Responsible for automatically finding threshold level if it was not provided
by the user

The threshold value is later used to set all values below the threshold to zero
in order to produce a density map which resembles those which were generated
by the mrc2pdb script with which the CNN was trained.

Threshold values are calculated using two different methods. First, we want to
find a threshold value such that the density map has a surface area to volume
ratio of 0.9. Secondly, we want to find a threshold value such that the ratio of
number of values larger than the threshold to number of non-zero values is
0.484. The median of both numbers is then used as the threshold value and stored
in a file at /preprocessing/threshold.
